# ðŸš§ Firewalls

## Get All

Returns a paginated list of accessible Firewalls.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

// Get All
List<Firewall> list = await linodeClient.Firewall.Get();
```

## Get One

Get a specific Firewall resource by its ID. The Firewallâ€™s Devices will not be returned in the response. Instead, use the [List Firewall Devices](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/networking/#firewall-devices-list) endpoint to review them.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

long firewallId = 109478;

// Get One
Firewall firewall = await linodeClient.Firewall.Get(firewallId);
```

## Create

Creates a Firewall to filter network traffic.

* Use the `rules` property to create inbound and outbound access rules.
* Use the `devices` property to assign the Firewall to a service and apply its Rules to the device. Requires `read_write` [Userâ€™s Grants](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#users-grants-view) to the device. Currently, Firewalls can only be assigned to Linode instances.
* A Firewall can be assigned to multiple Linode instances at a time.
* A Linode instance can have one active, assigned Firewall at a time. Additional disabled Firewalls can be assigned to a service, but they cannot be enabled if another active Firewall is already assigned to the same service.
* Firewalls apply to all of a Linodeâ€™s non-`vlan` purpose Configuration Profile Interfaces.
* Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.
* A `firewall_create` Event is generated when this endpoint returns successfully.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

// New firewall
Firewall firewall = new Firewall();

// Name
firewall.Label = "super-firewall";

// By default, we establish that nothing can enter, except explicitly specified in the incoming rule as "Action ACCEPT."
firewall.Rules.InboundPolicy = eFirewallRulAction.DROP;

// Allow port 22 tcp IN
FirewallRule firewallRuleIn22Tcp = new FirewallRule();
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Label = "tcp-22-in-allow";
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Description = "Allow al traffic int 22 tcp";
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Action = eFirewallRulAction.ACCEPT;
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Protocol = eFirewallProtocol.TCP;
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Ports = "22";
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Addresses = new FirewallRuleAddresses();
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Addresses.IPv4.Add("8.8.8.8/32");
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Addresses.IPv4.Add("1.1.1.1/32");
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Addresses.IPv6.Add("2a00:1450:4009:81f::200e/128");
firewallRuleIn22Tcp.Addresses.IPv6.Add("2606:4700::6810:84e5/128");

// Add rule to Firewall
firewall.Rules.Inbound.Add(firewallRuleIn22Tcp);

// Allow port 80 tcp IN
FirewallRule firewallRuleIn80Tcp = new FirewallRule();
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Label = "tcp-80-in-allow";
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Description = "Allow al traffic int 80 tcp";
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Action = eFirewallRulAction.ACCEPT;
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Protocol = eFirewallProtocol.TCP;
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Ports = "80";
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Addresses = new FirewallRuleAddresses();
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Addresses.IPv4.Add("8.8.8.8/32");
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Addresses.IPv6.Add("2606:4700::6810:84e5/128");

// Add rule to Firewall
firewall.Rules.Inbound.Add(firewallRuleIn80Tcp);

// By default, we establish that all traffic can exit, except explicitly specified in the outgoing rule as "Action DROP."
firewall.Rules.OutboundPolicy = eFirewallRulAction.ACCEPT;

// Deny port 27017 OUT
FirewallRule firewallRuleOut27017Tcp = new FirewallRule();
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Label = "tcp-27017-out-deny";
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Description = "Allow al traffic int 27017 tcp";
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Action = eFirewallRulAction.DROP;
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Protocol = eFirewallProtocol.TCP;
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Ports = "27017";
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Addresses = new FirewallRuleAddresses();
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Addresses.IPv4.Add("0.0.0.0/0");
firewallRuleOut27017Tcp.Addresses.IPv6.Add("::/0");

// Add rule to Firewall
firewall.Rules.Outbound.Add(firewallRuleOut27017Tcp);

// Tags
firewall.Tags = new List<string> { "22 in allow", "80 in allow", "27017 out deny" };

// Create
firewall = await linodeClient.Firewall.Create(firewall);
```

## Update

Updates information for a Firewall.

* Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.
* If a Firewallâ€™s status is changed with this endpoint, a corresponding `firewall_enable` or `firewall_disable` Event will be generated.

Some parts of a Firewallâ€™s configuration cannot be manipulated by this endpoint:

* A Firewallâ€™s Devices cannot be set with this endpoint. Instead, use the Create Firewall Device and Delete Firewall Device endpoints to assign and remove this Firewall from Linode services.
* A Firewallâ€™s Rules cannot be changed with this endpoint. Instead, use the Update Firewall Rules endpoint to update your Rules.
* A Firewallâ€™s status can be set to `enabled` or `disabled` by this endpoint, but it cannot be set to `deleted`. Instead, use the Delete Firewall endpoint to delete a Firewall.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

// Get one
Firewall firewall = await linodeClient.Firewall.Get(280563);

// Change
firewall.Label = "newName";
firewall.Status = eFirewallStatus.disabled;

// Update
firewall = await linodeClient.Firewall.Update(firewall);
```

## Delete

Delete a Firewall resource by its ID. This will remove all of the Firewallâ€™s Rules from any Linode services that the Firewall was assigned to.

* Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.
* A `firewall_delete` Event is generated when this endpoint returns successfully.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

// Get one
Firewall firewall = await linodeClient.Firewall.Get(280384);

// You can delete it by passing the object as a parameter
await linodeClient.Firewall.Delete(firewall);

// You can also delete it by passing the ID as a parameter.
await linodeClient.Firewall.Delete(280384);
```

## Rules List

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

long firewallId = 280563;

// Get
FirewallRules firewallRules = await linodeClient.Firewall.GetRules(firewallId);
```

## Rules Update

Updates the inbound and outbound Rules for a Firewall.

* Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.
* **Note**: This command replaces all of a Firewallâ€™s `inbound` and `outbound` rulesets with the values specified in your request.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

long firewallId = 280563;

// Get
FirewallRules firewallRules = await linodeClient.Firewall.GetRules(firewallId);

// Allow port 80 tcp IN
FirewallRule firewallRuleIn80Tcp = new FirewallRule();
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Label = "tcp-80-in-allow";
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Description = "Allow al traffic int 80 tcp";
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Action = eFirewallRulAction.ACCEPT;
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Protocol = eFirewallProtocol.TCP;
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Ports = "80";
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Addresses = new FirewallRuleAddresses();
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Addresses.IPv4.Add("8.8.8.8/32");
firewallRuleIn80Tcp.Addresses.IPv6.Add("2606:4700::6810:84e5/128");

// Add rule to Firewall
firewallRules.Inbound.Add(firewallRuleIn80Tcp);

// Update Rule
firewallRules = await linodeClient.Firewall.UpdateRule(firewallId, firewallRules);
```

## Devices List

Returns a paginated list of a Firewallâ€™s Devices. A Firewall Device assigns a Firewall to a Linode service (referred to as the Deviceâ€™s `entity`). Currently, only Devices with an entity of type `linode` are accepted.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

long firewallId = 280563;

// Get
List<FirewallDevice> list = await linodeClient.Firewall.DeviceGet(firewallId);
```

## Device View

Returns information for a Firewall Device, which assigns a Firewall to a Linode service (referred to as the Deviceâ€™s `entity`). Currently, only Devices with an entity of type `linode` are accepted.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

long firewallId = 280563;
long deviceId = 605747;

// Get
FirewallDevice firewallDevice = await linodeClient.Firewall.DeviceGet(firewallId, deviceId);
```

## Device Create

Creates a Firewall Device, which assigns a Firewall to a service (referred to as the Deviceâ€™s `entity`) and applies the Firewallâ€™s Rules to the device.

* Currently, only Devices with an entity of type `linode` are accepted.
* A Firewall can be assigned to multiple Linode instances at a time.
* A Linode instance can have one active, assigned Firewall at a time. Additional disabled Firewalls can be assigned to a service, but they cannot be enabled if another active Firewall is already assigned to the same service.
* Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.
* A `firewall_device_add` Event is generated when the Firewall Device is added successfully.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

long firewallId = 280563;
long linodeId = 52525566;

// Create device
FirewallDevice firewallDevice = await linodeClient.Firewall.DeviceCreate(firewallId, linodeId);
```

## Device Delete

Removes a Firewall Device, which removes a Firewall from the Linode service it was assigned to by the Device. This will remove all of the Firewallâ€™s Rules from the Linode service. If any other Firewalls have been assigned to the Linode service, then those Rules will remain in effect.

* Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.
* A `firewall_device_remove` Event is generated when the Firewall Device is removed successfully.

```csharp
LinodeClient linodeClient = new LinodeClient("apikey");

long firewallId = 280563;
long deviceId = 605801;

// Delete device
await linodeClient.Firewall.DeviceDelete(firewallId, deviceId);
```
